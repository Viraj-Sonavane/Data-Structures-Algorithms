### Compile your program by running the command: make
### To test your function, run the following command using correct test files: ./run < tests/t01.in > t01.my
### To better visualize the difference of the two outputs run this command: vimdiff tests/t01.out t01.my

#### Problem 1. Given a strongly connected directed graph G = (V, E), write a member function that returns an integer L, the length of the longest simple cycle in G and that prints this cycle starting with the smallest vertex in of the cycle and ending with the same vertex. The length of a cycle is measured in the number of edges on that cycle.You must write a public member function with the exact header as shown below:

int longestCycle();
