# Extra 

Find Rank. Given a binary search tree of integers, BST, and an integer akey, find the rank of this node in the BST tree and return the rank. Nodes in the BST do not have links to parents.

Requirements:- Your program (functions) must run in O(log(n))-time (if a BST is balanced, then height of the tree is O(log(n))), where n is the size of the given BST.- Your public function must be called findRank and take one parameter, the given integer, and return an integer, the rank of the node whose key is given:int findRank(int akey)- If the given value does not exist in the BST tree, then return -1.

### Compile your program by running the command: make
### To test your function, run the following command using correct test files: ./run < tests/t01.in > t01.my
### To better visualize the difference of the two outputs run this command: vimdiff tests/t01.out t01.my
