# Project 3 : In this project you will implement an undirected graph that is represented as an Adjacency Lists(implemented as vector<vector< edge > > Adj). You will use struct edge that contains two datamembers: an integer neighbor and an integer w. 


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Compile your program by running the command: make
#### To test your function, run the following command using correct test files: ./run < tests/t01.in > t01.my
#### To better visualize the difference of the two outputs run this command: vimdiff tests/t01.out t01.my

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Problem 1: Given an undirected graph G and two vertices u and v of G, design an algorithm that will return true if there are two distinct paths from u to v in G and will print these two paths; otherwise, it will return false and will not print anything. You will need to write the following public member function (with exact name, parameters, return type):bool distinctPaths(int u, int v).

#### Part 2 : Add member function remove that removes a node from the tree.
